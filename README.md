## Project Overview

***BlinksGPT*** is a highly trained assistant that provides in-depth insights about the Solana Blinks & Actions. It answers queries with precision, making complex Blinks topics accessible to **newcomers, researchers, enthusiasts, and developers.** <br>

BlinksGPT assists developers in building blinks on solana through a conversational UI, powered by **Blinks & Actions for "Subscription" Authorization, OpenAI Assistants, GPT-4o model, and the latest tech-stack.** <br>

It helps developers code, fix, and test their Blinks to build any type of applications within DSCVR Environment. Simply enter a prompt in the UI to get accurate answers. Specially designed for the Solana community of developers, BlinksGPT is developed by Asharib Ali as a submission for the **DSCVR Buildathon - Canvas Embedded Apps Fest** <br>

**BlinksGPT** offers many great features to help developers build and ship quickly unique **Blinks on Solana.** <br>

## Problem Statement with Solution

Developers want to build different blinks on solana but lack an interactive way to quickly and easily create any blink applications on Solana Blockchain. They might use ChatGPT, but it's trained on outdated data and doesn't know about the latest developments (Like Canvas on DSCVR, Blinks on Solana). Plus, GPT Plus costs $20 per month. That's why we need a specific assistant to address this issue: "Help developers write, fix, and test their "Blinks on Solana" within the DSCVR Environment" in a conversational way. I have trained it on a good amount of data and have prompt-engineered it to achieve the best results, BlinksGPT is hosted on vercel with best CSP Policies and available on the DSCVR as a Canvas App.

## Features

This is the first subscription-based service on the DSCVR Canvas. To access the application, you'll need to pay 0.1 Devnet SOL, which you can obtain using the Faucet. The service utilizes (Blinks and actions) within the DSCVR Environment. Ensure you have Devnet SOL in your wallet. Switch to Devnet on Phantom or Solflare.

🙌 First pay 0.1 devnet sol to access the application via (Solana Actions/Blink).<br>
🎯 Personalized answers for community & developers. <br>
🕒 Real-time updates from Internet. <br>
👨‍💻 Chat via CUI (Conversational User Interface). <br>
🎤 Voice functionality for easy interaction. <br>
👍 Provide Feedback. <br>
☑️12 Limit Messages per 24 hours. <br>
⚡Content Moderation Policies. <br>

## Benefits

🌟 Enhances developer experience. <br>
📰 Keeps the Solana community informed. <br>
🌐 Makes Solana more accessible. <br>
📈 Assist greater engagement and project development. <br>
